# Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

This GitHub repository contains a machine learning model for breast cancer prediction based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The model utilizes the logistic regression algorithm to make accurate predictions.

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and contains features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass. These features include various characteristics such as texture, radius, smoothness, and more. Each data sample in the dataset is labeled as either malignant (indicating the presence of breast cancer) or benign (indicating the absence of breast cancer).

The logistic regression algorithm is a popular binary classification method that estimates the probability of an input belonging to a particular class. In this case, the logistic regression algorithm is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to classify breast mass samples as either malignant or benign.

By leveraging this machine learning model and the logistic regression algorithm, you can predict whether a breast mass is likely to be malignant or benign, which can aid in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
